Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains my intermediate-level Machine Learning projects.
The goal is to practice data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, evaluation, and visualization while improving my understanding of real-world ML workflows.


Each project has its own folder containing:

notebook.ipynb â†’ Jupyter Notebook with code and explanations

dataset/ â†’ Dataset (if included or linked)

README.md â†’ Project-specific details

Tech Stack

Languages: Python

Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow / PyTorch (where applicable)

Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Git/GitHub

Key Concepts Covered

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Feature Engineering

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Supervised Learning (Regression & Classification)

Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC)

Hyperparameter Tuning

Basic NLP & Text Classification

Future Work

Add Deep Learning projects (CNNs, RNNs)

Deploy ML models using Flask / FastAPI / Streamlit

Work on larger real-world datasets
